- Continue

### Settings :
    - Enter hostname : 192.168.56.22.xip.io
    - INstallation Type : [Demo]
  - hit [save]  
 - Saved - [Restart Now] 
 > Note : ..then Starting in the left part of Dashboard - never changes unless you reload the page :-) 
 - Wait a couple of minutes, at the left rectangel, below the button [Stop now] there is link :
 192.168.56.22.xip.io, press it
 - Setup your admin
 - Now you are logged in


## Test
- Create some organization, for out example we going to use "ACME" ( enter name and some email address, you email address)
- On the next screen you are going to be proposed to create new workspace and attach VSC provides, you can skip attaching VSC provider for now , press the link "skip this tep"
- Enter some new for your workspace, for the test we use "playground"
- Let's prepare token for connecting : You can generate one on the [user settings page](https://192.168.56.22.xip.io/app/settings/tokens). Save generated user token somewhere safe.

- We need also setup a token in special file  - Terraform CLI Configuration file. This file is located at `%APPDATA%\terraform.rc` on Windows systems, and `~/.terraformrc` on other systems, with following content :
    ```
        credentials "192.168.56.22.xip.i" {
            token = "REPLACE_ME"
        }
    ```
    > Note replace the token above with your value from previous step
- And change config in main to look like : 
    ```terraform
    terraform {
        backend "remote" {
            hostname = "192.168.56.22.xip.io"
            organization = "ACME"

            workspaces {
            name = "playground"
            }
        }
    }
    ```

- Now we can create some basic Terraform configuration, and test our workspace
